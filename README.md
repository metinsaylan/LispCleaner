# LispCleaner

This is one of my oldest projects which was developed in 2010. It eliminates **acaddoc.lsp** issues caused by a lisp worm script.

Easiest way to clean this worm is using my windows application. This application scans all lsp files on your computer and removes any traces from the lisp files. Download the final version of the lisp cleaner application below:

If you donâ€™t want to run a software on your computer, you can also use lisp version below:
