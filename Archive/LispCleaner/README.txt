WARNING :
LispCleaner v1.2.x is designed to clean all acaddoc.lsp, acad.fas, acadapq.lsp and textdit.lsp files from selected folders in order to get rid of ALS/Bursted.xx worm. Please be informed that your regular lisp files will also be cleaned by removing infected parts. Before running the cleaner, I recommend backing up your important lisp files.
